    "info": "The Godfather \"Don\" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. He is at the event of his daughter's wedding. Michael, Vito's youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also present at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart.",

Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea, but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime.

But this time, the aliens have taken over a space colony on the moon LV-426. When the colonial marines are called upon to search the deserted space colony, they later find out that they are up against more than what they bargained for. Using specially modified machine guns and enough firepower, it's either fight or die as the space marines battle against the aliens. As the Marines do their best to defend themselves, Ripley must attempt to protect a young girl who is the sole survivor of the decimated space colony.",

Since then, the Collection has acquired over 250 sculptures and installations by more than 150 women, supporting an impressive range of practices across 75 years. Through an investigation of these important holdings, Breaking the Mould proposes a radical recalibration \u2013 a riposte to the many accounts of British sculpture that have marginalised women or airbrushed their work from the story altogether.",

    "info": "The motion is ceaseless. There is a lot going on, everywhere: tiny details, menacing gestures, surrealistic choreographies. It seems like the whole world is compressed in these canvases, squeezed in so little space. The perspective keeps shifting and the eye can\u2019t find a resting spot. What\u2019s going on here? Hastily, we look for something, not yet knowing what. We engage with the possible meaning of these paintings \u2013 to no avail, at first. Maybe we need to look closer, or from a distance. There must be an answer; the clue might be lying somewhere \u2013 the ultimate interpretation for what looks like a dream, a hallucination, perhaps just an ordinary event \u2013, it\u2019s just a matter of finding it. But we stall. We feel claustrophobic, overwhelmed. And then the motion starts all over again.",
